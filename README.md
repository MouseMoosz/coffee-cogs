## About this repo

These cogs were created because it was mind boggling as a non-coding Discord user learning that certain features didn't exist but was stupid easy to change or create as a Discord bot. The cogs in this repo were made out of pure desperation to solve some very specific pain points.

**I am new to Python development, and thus most of my code is likely to be very bad.** If you have an idea to improve on the code here, feel free to start Issues and Pull Requests!
