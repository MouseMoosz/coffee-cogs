## Cog Info

|Name|Info|
|---|---|
|dmreply|Upgrading the built-in DM feature to be more customizable. Made with the goal of helping support teams responding to queries via DM.|
|loveping|Ping someone to send them messages of love :) Set a webhook url, send the command, and the bot will rain back what you typed.|

|sendhook|Makes sending webhooks from the Discord chat super easy. Just give it a webhook url and a message! Can even save aliases for webhooks you want to send to often.|
|websearch|A simple Discord bot feature that gives you links to search engines like Google without needing to copy-paste and search it yourself.|


## About this repo

These cogs were created because it was mind boggling as a non-coding Discord user learning that certain features didn't exist but was stupid easy to change or create as a Discord bot. The cogs in this repo were made out of pure desperation to solve some very specific pain points.

**I am new to Python development, and thus most of my code is likely to be very bad.** If you have an idea to improve on the code here, feel free to start Issues and Pull Requests!
