## Cog Info

[Click here](https://index.discord.red/?filter=&ua=1) and search **`coffeebank`** to find and add my cogs!

|Name|Info|
|---|---|
|[bartender](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/tree/master/bartender)|Serve some yummy drinks to your fellow server members!|
|[coffeetime](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/tree/master/coffeetime)|Check timezones, user times, or times in specific places. Forked from aikaterna's improvements, cog originally by Fishyfing.|
|[coffeetools](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/tree/master/coffeetools)|Replacement for 'General' cog, since it needs to be disabled to override certain commands. Changes 'choose' to use \| divider.|
|[dmreply](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/tree/master/dmreply)|Replacing the built-in DM feature to be more customizable. Allows users specified as mods to send a customized DM embed to users via a User ID. Made with the goal of helping support teams responding to queries via DM, when used in conjunction with a cog that forwards received DMs to a server channel. Uses global settings, so only use this feature on bots hosted for a single server.|
|[emotes](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/tree/master/emotes)|Custom emote solution for non-nitro users. Use animated emotes in your server, even without Nitro. Make your own emote storage spreadsheet and generate emote-like image links for use in DMs and elsewhere.|
|[hellohook](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/tree/master/hellohook)|Create your own welcome bot with a custom profile picture! Choose between a regular message or an embed welcome, with a ping option.|
|[jsonrequest](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/tree/master/jsonrequest)|Send and receive a json request from Discord. Includes domain whitelisting by server.|
|[loveplay](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/tree/master/loveplay)|Send love to other members of the server with reaction gifs from Purrbot API. Does not require a user @mention (say '=hug server' all you like!). Includes: blush, cuddle, dance, hug, kiss, lick, neko, nom, pat, poke, slap. Also includes a custom reaction gif builder that works for any gif type from the Purrbot API. To replace built-in hug command, unload 'General' cog and install 'coffeetools' cog.|
|[msgmover](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/tree/master/msgmover)|Make moving messages between channels/servers easy and integrated, using webhooks. msgcopy: Copy messages from one channel to another. Move whole conversations, or merge channels easily with re-uploaded attachments, bot messages, and usernames/profiles replicated in full. Includes timestamp spacers. msgrelay: Relay messages from one channel to another channel/server. Supports usernames/profile pics, replies, attachments (files/images/video), and embeds (bot command replies). Supports edited/deleted messages. Supports forwarding to multiple webhooks/channels. Forward messages between different servers to bridge communities and share content.|
|[pinboard](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/tree/master/pinboard)|Make a bulletin board pinned message! Users can add/remove their own content to/from a shared, "bulletin board" style pinned message.|
|[quarantine](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/tree/master/quarantine)|Quarantine a user easily. Set a muterole and mod log channel, and any users specified will have their roles removed and replaced with the muterole.|
|[sendhook](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/tree/master/sendhook)|The comprehensive webhooks cog, with sending, listing, and creating of webhooks. Comes with support for webhook aliases and sending messages as your username/avatar. Perfect for users stuck on mobile Discord.|
|[spotifyembed](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/tree/master/spotifyembed)|Automatically send a reply to Spotify links with a link to the embed preview. Convenient for mobile users who can finally listen to music samples from Discord, without needing an account.|
|[websearch](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/tree/master/websearch)|A simple Discord bot feature that returns links to search engines like Google without needing to copy-paste a search term into a website/app separately. Comes preset with search strings for Google, Bing, Ecosia, and DuckDuckGo. Custom search strings can be added. Works similarly to LMGTFY, but without the passive aggressiveness.|


## About this repo

These cogs were created because it was mind boggling as a non-coding Discord user learning that certain features didn't exist but was stupid easy to change or create as a Discord bot. The cogs in this repo were made out of pure desperation to solve some very specific pain points.

**I am new to Python development, so most of my code is likely to suck.** If you have an idea to improve on the code here, feel free to start Issues and Pull Requests!
