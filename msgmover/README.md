## What is msgmover?

**msgmover** is a Discord bot made for redirecting chats, merging Discord channels, and linking up two Discord servers. The two main features rely on the same technology:

- **msgcopy**: Copy existing messages from one Discord channel into another Discord channel  

- **msgrelay**: Forward all new messages from one Discord channel into another Discord channel


## How does it work?

Each user's profile picture, nickname/username, and message is copied and pasted into the new channel/server.

**Currently supported:**
- Embeds
- Attachments (Images, videos, text, etc.)
- Replies

**Not supported yet:**
- Syncing message edits
- Syncing message deletes
